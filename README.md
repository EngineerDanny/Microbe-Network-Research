## Overview

The goal of this research is to explore and model the interactions between microbial species using [network analysis, machine learning, etc.]. Specifically, we aim to [summarize the purpose or findings, e.g., "identify key microbial species that play a crucial role in community stability"]. This repository includes the following components:
- **Source Code**: Scripts to perform the analysis.
- **Datasets**: Example datasets used in the study.
- **Results**: Visualizations and outputs generated from the analysis.
- **Documentation**: Detailed instructions to reproduce the research.
